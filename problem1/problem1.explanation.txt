EXPLANATION FOR PIRATES AND NINJAS SOLUTION

My solution for this problem works on a batch based system. How it works is that it takes 
as many pirates as it can at one time. We will then costume those pirates until they are completed.
Once all of the pirates are out, we will grab as many ninjas as we can and do them. 
This garuantees fairness by never depriving one group of the dressing room. It is fast
because we only have empty dressing rooms if one customer finishes before another. 

This solution uses locks.

Some sample outputs I used to test the program were these.
./problem1 2 10 10 10 10 10 10
./problem1 2 20 20 10 8 30 60
./problem1 4 50 50 10 8 100 200

Here is some output from a sample run.
I ended it early, but it is clear to see the batch system at work.
./problem1 4 10 10 10 10 10 10
